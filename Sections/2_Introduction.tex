\section{Introduction}
\tab The "Introduction" of the lab report identifies the experiment to be undertaken, the objectives of the experiment, the importance of the experiment, and overall background for understanding the experiment. In the “Introduction,” make sure that you orient the audience with sufficient background to understand what the purpose of the lab is. The introduction is kind of literature review. You can get sufficient information from the lab handout as well. NEVER copy from the internet unless you present your source.
